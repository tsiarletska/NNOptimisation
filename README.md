Lab, goal of which was the experiments with different oprimisators for CNN (used create model form Machine Learning Mastery, article "How to Develop a CNN for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification" by Jason Brownlee. The data used - MNIST.

The following optimisation algorithms were used: SGD, RMSProp, Adam, AdaGrad, AdaDelta (overall 31 experiment). Experiments were conducted based on change of optimisator, leaning rate and batch size. All results are stores in the Excel file (both a table with a summary and the results of each model in a separate tab (tho, I sometimes forgot to note down the result, so there are some gaps).

Assessment based on the following criteria: Mean accuracy, Mean stability metric, Mean Rate of Convergence Mean Convergence Speed Mean Initial Accuracy (First 5 Epochs) Mean Mid Accuracy (Middle Epochs) Mean Late Accuracy (Last 5 Epochs) (which were added to the model to fit the lab requirements). As a visual representation were used, graphs of loss and accuracy on train and test.
